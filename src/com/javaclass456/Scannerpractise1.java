        //it will allow us to enter an integer
        //input.nextInt();//if your variable is sc so it starts
        //sc.nextInt(); will enable us to input and int data to our program

        //input.nextLine();users can write any text you can write anything

        //input.nextDouble(); user can write any decimal value 10,20
        //ex:10->10.0

        //input.nextBoolean();user can write true or false only
        //input.nextByte();//127 is max value you can input




         //why i can not write in command line why I should use scanner?
          //there is a way to give input before starting the program
           //and there is a way to give input while the program is running(runtime) -> Scanner
